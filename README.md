#Modulo11

## Synopsis

Modulo11 is a small project dedicated to generating and validating bank numbers that are easy to remember. Since 2013, it is possible to choose your bank number in The Czech Republic, but statistically only ~ 9% of all possible combination meet the condition by Central National Bank.

## Motivation

As we are running e-commerce project, we wanted to have an easy to remember number. Unfortunately, bankers are not equipped with tools that can provide a possible suggestion. This situation creates time-consuming situations in which clients are in guess and check mode.

## Content

At the current moment, the repository contains just a single file modulo11.py that with a function which returns True or False if a number meet the modulo 11 conditions.
